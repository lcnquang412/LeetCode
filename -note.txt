Algorithm:
- The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm: is an efficient algorithm used to find the majority element (an element that appears more than half of the time) in a given array. This algorithm operates in linear time and requires O(1) additional space. It means that the remaining elements other than this would definitely be less than N/2

- Clever String Manipulation: A string s can be constructed by repeating a substring, then concatenating two copies of s together and removing the first and last character would still contain s as a substring
